Hello, my name is Madi and this is an OOP project
I tried to make a products database for online shopping website, shopping cart kinda
Here I'll upload only the source code of backend since I don't wanna use server and my website is bad ngl

I had no time to make UI, so there's only application that has 5 options:
  1. Get a product
  2. Get a product by name
  3. Add a new product
  4. Delete existing one
  5. The list of products
 and the exit button.

The project utilizes:
  Java
  PostgreSQL
  Encapsulation
  Inheritance
  Polymorphism
  and maybe something more
